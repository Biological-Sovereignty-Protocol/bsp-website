# BEO — Biological Entity Object

> Version 0.2 | Ambrósio Institute

---

## Overview

The **Biological Entity Object (BEO)** is the central unit of the BSP. Every piece of data in the BSP ecosystem is anchored to a BEO.

The BEO is **sovereign** — it belongs to the individual, not to any platform. It is stored on decentralized infrastructure (Arweave) and identified by a permanent `.bsp` domain name.

> **The difference between a BEO and a traditional medical record is fundamental:**
> The medical record belongs to the hospital. The BEO belongs to you.
> The hospital is only a contributor — not the owner.

## BEO Object Schema

```typescript
BEO {
  // ─── IDENTITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  beo_id:      string     // Universally unique biological identifier (UUID v4)
  domain:      string     // Human-readable address — e.g. "andre.bsp"
  created_at:  ISO8601    // When this entity was first registered
  version:     semver     // BSP version of this record

  // ─── CRYPTOGRAPHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  public_key:  string     // Owner's public key (RSA-4096 or Ed25519)
  key_version: number     // Increments on key rotation (starts at 1)

  // ─── DATA ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  records:     BioRecord[]  // All biological measurements
  protocols:   Protocol[]   // Active health protocols

  // ─── SOVEREIGNTY ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  sovereignty: SovereigntyMeta  // Ownership, consent, and recovery metadata

  // ─── STATUS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  active_recovery: object | null  // Active recovery request metadata, or null
  locked_at:       string | null  // ISO8601 timestamp if BEO is locked, or null
}

SovereigntyMeta {
  guardians:       Guardian[]   // Social recovery network (3 recommended)
  recovery_scheme: string       // "2-of-3" threshold
  seed_phrase_hash: string      // Hashed verification (phrase stored offline by user)
  consent_log:     ConsentEntry[] // All access authorizations — on-chain
}

Guardian {
  contact:     string              // How to reach this guardian (encrypted)
  public_key:  string             // Guardian's public key for the recovery protocol
  role:        string             // 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary'
  status:      'PENDING' | 'ACTIVE'  // Whether they have accepted the guardian role
  accepted_at: string | null      // ISO8601 timestamp of acceptance, or null if pending
}
```

## Creating a BEO

BEO creation is **open to anyone**. No permission from the Ambrósio Institute or any authority is required.

```typescript
// Using the bsp-sdk-typescript
import { BEOClient } from '@bsp/sdk'

const client = new BEOClient()

const beo = await client.create({
  domain: 'andre.bsp',       // Desired .bsp domain
  guardians: [               // Optional at creation — can add later
    { contact: 'maria@example.com', public_key: '...' },
    { contact: 'joao@example.com',  public_key: '...' },
  ]
})

console.log(beo.beo_id)   // "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
console.log(beo.domain)   // "andre.bsp"
```

```python
# Using the bsp-sdk-python
from bsp_sdk import BEOClient

client = BEOClient()

beo = client.create(
    domain="andre.bsp",
    guardians=[
        {"contact": "maria@example.com", "public_key": "..."},
    ]
)

print(beo.beo_id)    # "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
print(beo.domain)    # "andre.bsp"
```

## The .bsp Domain

Every BEO is identified by a human-readable `.bsp` domain — a permanent, sovereign biological address.

| Domain Type | Example | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Individual | `andre.bsp` | Free, permanent, non-transferable, tied to one BEO |
| Professional | `dr.carlos.bsp` | Paid, permanent, non-transferable, tied to practitioner IEO |
| Institutional | `fleury.bsp` | Paid, annual renewal, transferable, tied to IEO |
| Research | `usp.longevity.bsp` | Paid, tied to Research Partner certification |

→ See [`bsp-domain.md`](bsp-domain.md) for the complete domain system specification.

## BEO Properties

### Permanence
Once created, a BEO cannot be deleted — by the owner, by any institution, or by the Ambrósio Institute. The biological identity exists permanently on Arweave.

### Sovereignty
The individual holds the private key. No system — including the Ambrósio Institute — can access the BEO's data without explicit authorization from the key holder.

### Portability
All data within a BEO can be exported in BSP-standard format at any time. No lock-in.

### Immutability
BioRecords cannot be altered once written. Corrections are submitted as new BioRecords that supersede previous records — preserving the complete audit trail.

---

## Lock / Unlock BEO

The BEO holder can temporarily **lock** their BEO, freezing all data exchange operations. While locked, the AccessControl smart contract rejects every transaction — reads, writes, and new consent requests all return error `BSP-E-014`.

Locking does not revoke existing consent tokens. It suspends their effect until the BEO is unlocked. This is useful during key compromise investigations, extended travel, or any situation where the holder wants to pause all access without permanently revoking consents.

### Lock

```typescript
import { BEOClient } from '@bsp/sdk'

const client = new BEOClient({ ownerKey: myPrivateKey })

await client.lock({
  beo_id: '550e8400-...',
  reason: 'Key compromise investigation'  // Optional, stored on-chain
})
// BEO is now frozen — all exchange operations rejected
```

### Unlock

```typescript
await client.unlock({
  beo_id: '550e8400-...'
})
// BEO is active again — existing consent tokens resume effect
```

### Properties

- Only the BEO holder (private key owner) can lock or unlock
- Lock/unlock events are recorded permanently on Arweave
- The `locked_at` field on the BEO object reflects the current lock timestamp (or `null` if unlocked)
- Guardians cannot lock or unlock a BEO — only the holder
- A locked BEO can still be recovered through the Social Recovery Protocol

---

## Access Control

All third-party access to a BEO is governed by the **AccessControl** smart contract on Arweave.

Any system that wants to read from or write to a BEO must:
1. Request authorization from the BEO holder
2. Receive a signed consent token from the holder
3. Submit that token with every transaction

Without a valid token, the smart contract automatically rejects the transaction. The individual is the gatekeeper — not the Ambrósio Institute.

Consent tokens are:
- **Scoped** — limited to specific data categories and intents
- **Time-limited** — expire automatically unless renewed
- **Revocable** — the holder can revoke at any time
- **Auditable** — all grants and revocations are permanently recorded on-chain

→ See [`exchange.md`](exchange.md) for the complete consent token specification.

---

## Social Recovery

If a BEO holder loses their private key, recovery is possible through the guardian network.

**Recovery requires:** 2 of 3 guardians to confirm the holder's identity.

No single guardian can restore access alone. No central server is involved. The recovery protocol is executed on-chain.

**Guardian setup:**
1. At BEO creation (recommended), designate 3 trusted people
2. Each guardian accepts the role and provides a public key
3. Recovery threshold: 2-of-3 signatures required

→ See [`bsp-domain.md`](bsp-domain.md) for recovery protocol details.

## BEO vs IEO — Key Distinctions

| Property | BEO (Individual) | IEO (Institution) |
|---|---|---|
| Represents | A living human being | An organization, system, or professional |
| Created by | The individual | Any institution, directly |
| Transferable | Never | Yes — on acquisition or merger |
| Can read BEOs | Own data only | Only with valid consent token |
| Can write to BEOs | Cannot | Yes — with AccessControl authorization |
| Domain format | `firstname.bsp` | `institutionname.bsp` |
| Cost | Free — sovereignty is a right | Paid — annual certification fee |

→ See [`ieo.md`](ieo.md) for the complete IEO specification.
