# BSP Governance — Protocol Changes and BIPs

> Version 0.2 | Ambrósio Institute

---

## Overview

The BSP specification evolves through a public improvement process — **BSP Improvement Proposals (BIPs)**.

Any individual, company, or institution can propose changes to the protocol. The Ambrósio Institute reviews all proposals and coordinates community discussion. Critical protocol changes require multi-signature authorization.

---

## Governance Principles

1. **Openness** — Anyone can propose a BIP. No institutional affiliation required.
2. **Transparency** — All proposals, discussions, and decisions are public.
3. **Conservative change** — Protocol changes have a high bar. Stability is a feature.
4. **Backward compatibility** — Accepted changes must not break existing implementations, unless the break is clearly necessary and the migration path is defined.
5. **Institute guardianship** — The Ambrósio Institute is the guardian of the specification, not its owner. The protocol serves the ecosystem.

## Submitting a BIP

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy `bip/BIP-0000-template.md` to `bip/BIP-XXXX-your-title.md`
3. Fill in the template completely
4. Open a Pull Request

The PR opens the 30-day public review period. The Ambrósio Institute will schedule a review call for proposals that reach community consensus.

---

## Critical Parameter Changes

Changes to smart contract parameters or the Governance contract itself require **multi-signature authorization** from Institute keyholders.

This prevents unilateral changes — including by the Institute's founder. The protocol is protected from any single actor.
